-- FIUBA CTF: Level 7 --

After successfully finishing all Nicholas Sparks books, you think it's better to take on something more classic and start reading Edgar Allan Poe stories. However, your hacking instincts always awake, you smell you can exploit the stories website.

Your goal for this level is to find the stories site private keys. You can find the site on 10.0.0.2:8007.

As always, you can stop the level with "stop-level-7" whenever you are done.
