-- FIUBA CTF: Level 6 --

After a weekend showing your little nephew the games of your childhood, you want to play Age of Mythology again. However, the official Steam version is too expensive for your university teacher salary, so you choose to look at... not so legal pages. 

Looking carefully at the reviews of one of these pages, you think you can exploit it like if you were some Son of Osiris.

Your goal for this level is to steal the cookies of the site's users. You can find it on 10.0.0.2:8006 on your browser.

Don't forget to stop the level with "stop-level-6".
