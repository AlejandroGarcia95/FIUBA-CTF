-- FIUBA CTF: Level 8 --

Your new job as a secret agent could not be more exciting: your life is full of fights against criminals, trips around the world, technological gadgets and fabulous hats. However, crime never rests, and evildoers are constantly developing new ways for avoiding the long arm of the law.

It is at this context that, while pursuing a dangerous gang of pirate movie dealers, you have reasons to believe they are using a Leonardo DiCaprio fansite as their base for evil operations.

Your goal for this level is to find the gang secret messages. You can visit their fansite on 10.0.0.2:8008.

As always, you can stop the level with "stop-level-8" whenever you are done.
